Activity 1
1. Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds?
no, mother, father, brother, dog, and cat.

2. Think of several keywords and the responses they might cause.
Bot/Robot/Ai - This could cause something to say it is not a robot or AI to convince the end user they are talking to a human.
Bread - Let's get this bread
Profound words - Stop using language like that!

Activity 2
1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know
all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the
responses to these statements.
It doesn't respond due to the statements being case sensitive.

Activity 4
1. Find an example of when this structure does not work well. How can you improve it?
If you say "I want to say hi" it will respond with "What makes you want to to say hi?"
This can be fixed by removing the word "to" from the beginning when its used.
