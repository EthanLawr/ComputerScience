Ch 3 My Boolean Program: (LARGE PROGRAM GRADE)

Create a program that initializes 5 integer variables with the 5 numbers below.

	myInt1=100, myInt2=97, myInt3=32, myInt4=5, myInt5=61.

Perform the following comparisons:
Is value a equal to value b? (compare 1 with 2, then 2 with 3, …, 5 with 1) (5 total comparisons)

Is value a less than value b? (compare 1 with 2, then 2 with 3, …, 5 with 1) (5 total comparisons)

Is any value equal to 1, 10, or 100? (do for each value; 5 total tests)
	Logical Comparison Operators & Bool type (short-circuit OR)
	Use Regions to make your code easier to work with
