## Topics
This is based on high school classes of C# Computer Science 1, C# Computer Science 2, and Java Computer Science AP
There are also side projects for extra languages or extra pieces of code for extra help to you as a fellow programmer.
The intent of this project is to help record courses for the purpose of educating those who do not have access to such classes easily.
