## What is this?
This is based on high school classes of C# Computer Science 1, C# Computer Science 2, and Java Computer Science AP. What is included in here are all of the programs that I completed. In Folders named "Side Project" are some projects that have nothing to do with the courses spoken of beforehand. Please use this repository as a learning tool. If you just copy and paste from here you will not learn much, so use it as a guide more than anything. If you have any questions about programs feel free to send me a message about it, I will answer when I am able to.
